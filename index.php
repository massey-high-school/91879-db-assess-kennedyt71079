            <h2>The Bite-Sized Food Review, Welcomes you</h2>
            
            <p>
                Food is essential to life as we know it. Without the joy of chewing on whatever it may be and swallowing it we would simply cease to exist. It can be tough choosing what you eat in a day, but luckily, the Bites Review too exists, and can help you decide what to eat.

                Reviews range from breakfast to dessert, so whatever time of day it is for you, I'm sure that you will find something to satisfy your cravings. I personally love steak and would prefer a good steak over a rich chocolate cake, I usually cant get more than 3 bites into a dessert without feeling overwhelemed with sugar.

                I have not tried every food in the world, so expect a lack of the exact type of meal that you are looking for, if that is the case for you and you would like to add a review to the website, please feel free to do so.
